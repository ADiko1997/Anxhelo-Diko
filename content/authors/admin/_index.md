# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: A hardworking and ambitious individual with a great passion for Computer Vision. Currently, I am enrolled in the second year of the Ph.D. in Computer Science program at the Sapienza University of Rome. As a Ph.D. fellow, my main research focuses on artificial intelligence and computer vision, believing that pixels, the closest representation of the physical world constraints, are the key to next-generation artificial general intelligence. More specifically, I am currently focusing my research on human activity understanding and anticipation from camera sensors, which is a key problem for many autonomous agents relying on perception as their main driving force and for virtual reality (VR). Additionally, another issue that has gotten my interest, directly related to the fantastic world of activity understanding, is the view-invariant representation of learning from videos. A capability that today's agents do not possess but could be beneficial to see and perceive the same thing from different perspectives. <\ br> Besides my research interest, I have a strong engineering background cultivated throughout my academic and industry journey. I possess remarkable programming prowess, particularly in Python, my principal tool for rapid prototyping, followed by essential versioning tools and deep/machine learning frameworks. Furthermore, my adeptness extends to C++ and parallel programming using CUDA. This engineering foundation and my theoretical and practical knowledge of the computer science and vision fields enable me to easily adapt my ideas into working prototypes following the best practices. <\ br> Finally, I aspire to contribute substantially to the continually evolving landscape of computer vision and deep learning through advanced research and innovative endeavors. Specifically, I intend to significantly contribute to the current state of action anticipation and view-invariant representation learning.
