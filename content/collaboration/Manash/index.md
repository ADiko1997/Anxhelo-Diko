abstract: We present a numerical investigation of the airflow dynamics and particle transport through an averaged human nasal cavity. The effect of particle size and breathing rate on the deposition patterns are explored. The simulations reveal that smaller particles penetrate deeper into the airway, whereas larger particles agglomerate near the anterior portion of the nasal cavity. Increasing the flow rate augmented the penetration of the particles. The complex interplay of the finite particle size and the flow inertia decided the spatial deposition of the particles. The findings from this study demonstrate the efficacy of state-of-art simulation frameworks for targeting respiratory disorders.
