abstract: The knee is an essential part of our body, and identifying its injuries is crucial since it can significantly affect quality of life. To date, the preferred way of evaluating knee injuries is through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which is an effective imaging technique that accurately identifies injuries. The issue with this method is that the high amount of detail that comes with MRIs is challenging to interpret and time consuming for radiologists to analyze. The issue becomes even more concerning when radiologists are required to analyze a significant number of MRIs in a short period. For this purpose, automated tools may become helpful to radiologists assisting them in the evaluation of these images. Machine learning methods, in being able to extract meaningful information from data, such as images or any other type of data, are promising for modeling the complex patterns of knee MRI and relating it to its interpretation. In this study, using a real-life imaging protocol, a machine-learning model based on convolutional neural networks used for detecting medial meniscus tears, bone marrow edema, and general abnormalities on knee MRI exams is presented. Furthermore, the modelâ€™s effectiveness in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity is evaluated. Based on this evaluation protocol, the explored models reach a maximum accuracy of 83.7%, a maximum sensitivity of 82.2%, and a maximum specificity of 87.99% for meniscus tears. For bone marrow edema, a maximum accuracy of 81.3%, a maximum sensitivity of 93.3%, and a maximum specificity of 78.6% is reached.
